### Hi! I'm Brian.

I'm a 3rd-year EE Ph.D. student at Stanford University working in the [Stanford Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.computationalimaging.org), advised by [Gordon Wetzstein](https://web.stanford.edu/~gordonwz).

My research focuses on computational imaging, displays, and physical optics, and how they are combined with modern graphics, 3D-ML, and generative ML techniques to create novel AR/VR experiences.
